## Style Guidelines:

- Primary/Background Color: Light cream (#F5F5DC) to provide a luxurious and clean base. Ensure it feels warm and inviting, not sterile.
- Text & Dark Elements Color: Rich chocolate brown (#3D2B1F) for all primary text, ensuring high contrast and readability. Can also be used for subtle dividers or structural elements.
- Buttons & Accents Color: Striking bronze/gold (#B8860B) used strategically for all primary call-to-action buttons, important highlights, active navigation states, and focus indicators. This color is key to the premium feel.
- Headline Font ('Playfair Display'): Consistently for page titles, main section headers, and prominent product names. Ensure proper font weights are used for hierarchy.
- Body Font ('PT Sans'): For all descriptive text, labels, table content. Focus on legibility and a clean presentation.
- Modern, spacious, and centered layouts. Emphasize responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile, ensuring the premium experience translates to all screen sizes.
- Select a set of elegant, minimalist icons (e.g., Feather Icons, Heroicons, or a custom premium set if available) that are consistent in style and weight. Use them sparingly to enhance usability, not clutter the interface.
- Subtle hover effects on buttons and product cards (e.g., slight shadow lift, gentle scaling, a bronze glow). Smooth transitions between page states.
